### Contributing to COSSI

To add new data to COSSI or update existing data, you'll need to update the JSON data in [COSSI.json](COSSI.json) and the Markdown Table in [README.md](README.md), and submit both updated files in a pull request.

Here are the recommended guidelines:

1. Make your changes to the index in [COSSI.json](COSSI.json)
2. Copy the contents of your updated COSSI.json file
3. Open [JSON to Markdown Table](https://kdelmonte.github.io/json-to-markdown-table/) and paste the contents of the updated COSSI.json file
4. You should now see the updated COSSI.json data formatted as a **Markdown Table** as well as a **Table Preview**
5. Examine the **Table Preview** section and confirm your changes appear as expected.  (If something went wrong, return to step #1 or #2)
6. If your changes appear as expected, copy the updated **Markdown Table**
7. Replace the current Markdown Table in [README.md](README.md) with your updated version
8. When you have updated both the COSSI.json file and the Markdown Table in README.md, create a pull request.
